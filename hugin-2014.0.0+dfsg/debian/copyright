 | iccprofile.{c,h}
 |
 | This file provides code to read and write International Color Consortium
 | (ICC) device profiles embedded in JFIF JPEG image files.  The ICC has
 | defined a standard format for including such data in JPEG "APP2" markers.
 | The code given here does not know anything about the internal structure
 | of the ICC profile data; it just knows how to put the profile data into
 | a JPEG file being written, or get it back out when reading.
 |
 | This code depends on new features added to the IJG JPEG library as of
 | IJG release 6b; it will not compile or work with older IJG versions.
 |
 | NOTE: this code would need surgery to work on 16-bit-int machines
 | with ICC profiles exceeding 64K bytes in size.  If you need to do that,
 | change all the "unsigned int" variables to "INT32".  You'll also need
 | to find a malloc() replacement that can allocate more than 64K.

 | This file contains code to read and write four byte rgbe file format
 | developed by Greg Ward.  It handles the conversions between rgbe and
 | pixels consisting of floats.  The data is assumed to be an array of floats.
 | By default there are three floats per pixel in the order red, green, blue.
 | (RGBE_DATA_??? values control this.)  Only the mimimal header reading and
 | writing is implemented.  Each routine does error checking and will return
 | a status value as defined below.  This code is intended as a skeleton so
 | feel free to modify it to suit your needs.
